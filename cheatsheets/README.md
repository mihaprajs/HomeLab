# Cheat-sheets

This directory contains everything I found out or learned while setting up my Homelab. It will not contain any scripts,
but rather a *markdown* files for specific systems. In these files will be every tip and every trick I find while setting
up the **Homelab**. Every thing you find in this directory is scattered around the files for specific VMs or LXCs.
